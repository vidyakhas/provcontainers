# Format:
#       type character followed by a quoted string representation of value.
#          e.g a boolean -  property=B"true"
#       Lowercase type character implies primitives. Type can be omitted for String.

#           S = Short             C = Character          B = Boolean
#
#       Array format is property=<type>["<value1>","<value2>"].
